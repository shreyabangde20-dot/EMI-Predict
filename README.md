# EMI-Predict

**Project Title:
EMIPredict AI – Intelligent Financial Risk Assessment Platform**
**Introduction:**

In today’s world, millions of people struggle with EMIs due to poor financial planning and lack of risk awareness.
Financial institutions also face challenges identifying whether a borrower can genuinely afford a loan.
To solve this, EMIPredict AI has been developed — a smart, AI-powered solution that predicts both EMI eligibility and maximum EMI affordability using advanced Machine Learning techniques.
This project brings together data analysis, automation, and intelligence into a single interactive platform built with Streamlit, making EMI prediction accurate, fast, and accessible to everyone.

**Project Description:**

EMIPredict AI is an intelligent, end-to-end financial risk assessment platform that integrates multiple machine learning models and MLflow tracking to deliver precise insights into a user’s credit and EMI profile.
The platform performs two tasks:

**Classification:** Determines if a user is eligible for an EMI.

**Regression:** Predicts the maximum EMI amount the user can afford.

It combines 22+ financial and demographic features, engineered ratios, and real-time scoring to generate meaningful, explainable outcomes.

**Technologies Used:**

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Streamlit (Web App)

MLflow (Experiment Tracking)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Joblib (Model Serialization)

**Machine Learning Models:
🔹 Classification Models:**

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

🔹 **Regression Models:**

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Each model is evaluated using relevant metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC (for classification) and RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE (for regression).

**Conclusion:**
EMIPredict AI provides a modern, data-driven approach to financial risk assessment.
By merging intelligent algorithms, automation, and clean visual dashboards, it empowers both individuals and financial institutions to make smarter, faster, and fairer credit decisions.

This platform isn’t just about prediction — it’s about creating financial awareness and responsibility, helping users plan their future with confidence
